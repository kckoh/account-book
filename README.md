# account-book website

# Project background
* i was usuing one of an account book app and it was too complicated. I needed something simpler and practical from the perspectives of students.
* So i decided to make a website that keeps track of a simple income and expenses

# Target users

# stuents who do not keep track of all the little details

# functional requirements
* Users should be able to type in incomes and spends.
* Users can access to the history (can go back in time by months to see the record)
* Users should be able to see the total income and total spends

# Non- funcitonal requirements
